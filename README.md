# test 2 creating a local folder

to make it a git repository
use "git init" command

because this is created locally on my machine, so it's not connected to any repo in github

one way is to create a new empty repo in github and then push

1
"$ git remote add origin git@github.com:Chaotic8023-cs/test-repo2.git"

copy ssh link after "git remote add origin"

2
"$ git remote -v"

check the connection
